# Lucky Beard Assessment

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

## Reasoning behind CSS Framework Selection

Bootstrap provides a solid foundation with a wide range of components and utilities, making it easy to rapidly build responsive and consistent user interfaces. 

## Issues Experienced and Solutions Implemented

No significant issues were encountered during the assessment. However, minor challenges such as layout adjustments and styling tweaks were quickly addressed by using my own judgment.

## Areas for Improvement with Additional Time

Given more time, several aspects of the assessment could be refined and enhanced:
- Implementation of assessment in React
- Investing time in restructuring and optimizing files for cleaner and more maintainable code
